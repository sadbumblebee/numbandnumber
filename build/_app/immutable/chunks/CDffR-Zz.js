And as any younger sibling may relate: at some point we stumble across our family photo albums and realize: my older siblings each have a photo album … where’s mine? Why don’t I have one?</p> <img class="post-img svelte-4vldg" alt="A film photograph of the author as a kid striking a pinata dalmation with a baseball bat.

Surely, I wouldn’t do the same thing. So I took a look at the data.</p> <!> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Here are the total photos I took of my daughter, six months since her birth … Just over 700 photos.</p> <!> <p class="svelte-4vldg">And here are the total photos I took of my son. It’s half that amount.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Even if we P-hack this a bit … and included photos of my daughter <em class="svelte-4vldg">with</em> my son. That brings us to a modest 507 photos over 6 months.</p> <!> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Does that make me bad dad?</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">What does it say about us when we look at the data we collect, specifically the data I collect on my children?</p> <h3 class="svelte-4vldg">Welcome to my meta analysis …</h3> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Let’s back up a bit and talk about Data. In our practice, collecting data is part in parcel of telling a story.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">My daughter was born during the pandemic, so there was a <em class="svelte-4vldg">touch</em> of uncertainty. We took that uncertainty (and free time) to channeled it into our kid.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Take feeding our kid. A newborn baby feeds every two to three hours.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Terrified we’d miss a feeding, we did what any normal parent would do: we setup a database.</p> <img class="post-img svelte-4vldg" alt="A diagram on how to use a nasal passage suction for removing snot from a baby." src="/posts/second-child-syndrome/feeding_diagram.jpg"/> <p class="svelte-4vldg">With every feeding we used our phones to input the data, an Arduino would take an average of recent feedings and display when to feed our daughter next on a magnetic eInk display we could take anywhere.</p> <img class="post-img svelte-4vldg" alt="A photograph of an eInk display showing the next feeding should be 10:47 PM and the last feeding at 8:17PM." src="/posts/second-child-syndrome/feeding_clock.jpg"/> <p class="svelte-4vldg">This thing was amazing, it didn’t tell us the time, it told us the time to feed.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">And I think it helped. Not only in gaining all this data, it soothed our fears we’d starve her.</p> <!> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Here’s every feeding down to the minute over a three month period.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Sadly the highlighted circles are bottle feedings, clearly from Mom’s first weekend away.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">This informed us to get <strong class="svelte-4vldg">ME</strong> (and him) on the bottle earlier and more often.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">A side note: In research for this talk, I had forgotten we even tracked the girls pee’s and poops.</p> <img class="post-img svelte-4vldg" alt="A screenshot of a Google spreadsheet detailing bowel movements of a child by timestamp." src="/posts/second-child-syndrome/poo_spreadsheet.png"/> <p class="svelte-4vldg">So naturally when our second child was born last June, we would dust off the display and use the API again right?</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Readers: We did not use the app.</p> <p class="timestamp svelte-4vldg">Wednesday, Dec 18 – 9:02AM</p> <p class="chat message-from svelte-4vldg">I forgot to ask when he was last fed</p> <p class="chat message-to svelte-4vldg">5 am</p><p class="svelte-4vldg"></p><p class="svelte-4vldg">We moved across the country. We changed jobs. We were raising a two year old (now three year old). And we also had experience!</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">Look, the baby panopticon is real. There’s no ceiling to what you can record on your kids in this cradle to surveillance state pipeline.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">I mean <a href="https://www.happiestbaby.com/products/snoo-smart-bassinet" target="_blank" class="svelte-4vldg">this thing</a> will text you if your baby’s fussing and it costs north of a grand.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">At this conference we learn to collect and present data.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">In my own life, I think DOING the collecting was a means to satisfy the fear. The fear of missing out, the fear of forgetting, the fear of not being a good dad.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">What I think is easy to miss is how things build off one another. We change as we’re challenged with no sleep, bigger family in a struggling industry.</p> <p class="svelte-4vldg">In the end: the kids got fed. They took poops of every hue. The data we collect is just one dimension. And while it’s easy to focus on the delta, as a middle child, I’d encourage you to think of the sum of experiences instead.</p>',1);function re(u){var o=F(),i=d(q(o),10);v(i,{slug:"second-child-syndrome",name:"photo_chart",description:"This line chart shows number of photos captured in the Y-Axis of my first kid over 180 days (in the X-Axis).
